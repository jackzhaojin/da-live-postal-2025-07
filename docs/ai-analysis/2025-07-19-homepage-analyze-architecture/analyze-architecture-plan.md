My prompt:

> /analyze is runningâ€¦ --architecture --plan I need to get my current page that's on 
https://main--da-live-postal-2025-07--jackzhaojin.aem.page/ to look like https://young-shadow-1623.21st.app/ . Do not code yet. 
I already have the DA document that's supposed to have the authoring capabilities in file newpage1-input.html . Please plan on 
overriding the overall CSS look and feel, then create plans fore each "block" with <table /> and create additional components.
