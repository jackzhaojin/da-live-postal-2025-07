1. Install [AEM Code Sync](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync).

### 2. DA content
1. Browse to https://da.live/start.
2. Follow the steps.

### 3. Local development
1. Clone your new repo to your computer.
1. Install the AEM CLI using your terminal: `sudo npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
1. **Start local development server**: `aem up` (runs on port 3000 - no need for npm install first!)
1. Open the `{repo}` folder in your favorite code editor and build something.
1. **Recommended:** Install common npm packages like linting and testing: `npm i`.

## üöÄ Development Commands
